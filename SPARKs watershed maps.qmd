# SPARKs Fire Deficit Maps

Fire deficit and surplus is a measure of recent fire frequency compared to historical fire frequency. Historical fire regimes are based on Landfire fire return intervals.

```{r}
# How to interpret surplus/deficit values: Values above zero are surplus, and represent the number of times more an area has burned than it should have (i.e. a value of 2 means the area has burned twice as often as expected). Values below zero are deficit, and are interpretable in the same way (-2 means the area should have burned twice as often as it did).
```

Fire deficit calculations are based on total fires, *including prescribed burns*.

For regional calculations, we totaled areas in 5 categories:

-   Substantial deficit: burns are less than one third of expected, based on historical fire regime
-   Moderate deficit: burns are more than one third of expected, but less than 80% of expected
-   Balanced: burns are within 20% of expected
-   Moderate surplus: burns are more than 120% of expected but less than 3 times expected
-   Substantial surplus: burns are more than 3 times expected
